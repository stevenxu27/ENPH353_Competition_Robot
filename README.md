# Autonomous Robot Competition

Developing an autonomous robot in ROS Gazebo to navigate through an obstacle course and read clue boards using a trained character recognition model.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Usage

A few examples of useful commands and/or tasks.

### Branches

* Main: Most up-to-date implemented drive and image recognition.
* Image_processing: Optimizing different models to train the most efficient model for character recognition from different perspective
* Bugfix:
* etc...
